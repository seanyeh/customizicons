# Customizicons

Create custom GitHub-style identicons

If you're tired of your default GitHub profile picture
([identicon](https://blog.github.com/2013-08-14-identicons/)), but still like
the 5x5 pixelated style, you can now create your own GitHub-style identicon!
(with multi-color support as well)
